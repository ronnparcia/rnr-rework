# Rant and Rave by The LaSallian

This repository is a rework of the original [thelasallian/tls-rantandrave](https://github.com/thelasallian/tls-rantandrave) code, 
using the [Slim](https://www.slimframework.com/) and [Twig](https://twig.symfony.com/) to implement proper routing, pagination, 
and templating.

*Rant and Rave* is a kind of article written by [**The LaSallian**](https://thelasallian.com/)'s Menagerie section. These articles 
"rate the latest hits from the media industryâ€”from movies and shows to music both local and international." Film festivals, award 
shows, games, and food are also rated. This website collates these articles and displays them in review aggregator-like pages.
